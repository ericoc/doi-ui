# Notes

## BibTeX
- Need to learn more:

## Authors
- It checks the [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) of any author (_who has an ORCID_), 
who is not already affiliated with Penn, in order to see if they have a Penn
employment within their `ORCID`.
  - For example, the DOI
  [`10.1038/s41586-024-08156-8`](https://doi.ericoc.com/?doi=10.1038/s41586-024-08156-8#search)
  includes _Eric Stach_ as an author, who can be identified as related to Penn
  by [his ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3366-2153), but is not listed as
  affiliated with Penn on that specific DOI itself.
