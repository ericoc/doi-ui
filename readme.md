Experimenting with searching/displaying Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs),
using Python `requests` and `orcid`.

### DOI?
> A DOI is a digital identifier of an object, any object -
physical, digital, or abstract. DOIs solve a common problem:
keeping track of things. Things can be matter, material, content, or
activities. Designed to be used by humans as well as machines,
DOIs identify objects persistently. They allow things to be uniquely
identified and accessed reliably. You know what you have, where it is,
and others can track it too.

### BibTeX
> The word ,,BibTeX'' stands for a tool and a file format which are used to
describe and process lists of references, mostly in conjunction with LaTeX documents.

Need to learn more and implement this.
