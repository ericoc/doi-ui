Experimenting with searching/displaying Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).

### DOI?
> A DOI is a digital identifier of an object, any object -
physical, digital, or abstract. DOIs solve a common problem:
keeping track of things. Things can be matter, material, content, or
activities. Designed to be used by humans as well as machines,
DOIs identify objects persistently. They allow things to be uniquely
identified and accessed reliably. You know what you have, where it is,
and others can track it too.
