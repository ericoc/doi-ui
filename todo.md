# TODO

## Moving from Flask to Django.

## Authors
- Need to check [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) of any author (who has an ORCID), 
who is not already affiliated with Penn, in order to see if they are
Penn-affiliated via their `ORCID`.
  - For example, DOI [10.1038/s41586-024-08156-8](https://doi.ericoc.com/?doi=10.1038/s41586-024-08156-8#search)
  includes Eric Stach, who can be identified as related to Penn by his ORCID.

### ORCIDs
_Just a few ORCIDs..._

- Eric O'Callaghan
  - https://orcid.org/0009-0001-2996-1396
- Eric Stach
  - https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3366-2153
- Jamie Ford
  - https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7657-2465

## References
- OK.

## Dates
- ~~Fix `parse_date()` for DOI `10.1016/S0091-679X(01)67003-1`~~
- Seems OK.

## Funders
- Need to start migrating fund(er)s from Flask [`old_flask.py`](old_flask.py).
